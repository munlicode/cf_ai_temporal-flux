# Flux

**Build a step-by-step roadmap from any idea.**

### 🚀 What you can do

Flux understands natural language. You can talk to it like a project manager or a coworker.

#### 1. Architect a Goal

Break down a vague intent into a concrete sequence of tasks.

- `I want to learn German`
- `I want to launch a SaaS landing page using Cloudflare`
- `I want to build a fitness routine for the next 30 days`

#### 2. Dynamic Scheduling

Add or modify tasks directly on your timeline.

- `Schedule workout tomorrow at 8am`
- `Remind me to buy milk at 6pm`
- `Change my 3pm meeting to be high priority`
- `Delete the task about German grammar`
- `Mark the task 'Buy milk' as completed` (or unmark it)

#### 3. Contextual Plans

Manage multiple separate timelines for different parts of your life.

- `Create a new plan for my Summer Vacation`
- `Switch to my 'Project Alpha' plan`
- `List all my active plans`

## 🌱 Why

I had an idea for an app that would assist with my daily life—reminding me of promises, adjusting for me, and helping me be a better version of myself. I've focused this assignment on the part of that vision that is most clear: turning vague goals into concrete execution plans.

Most of the time, we want to do something, but we just tell ourselves **'Later'**. As Sigmund Freud said, _'Depression is the silence of emotions that have been told they are not allowed to speak.'_ When we delay our intents, we are essentially silencing a part of ourselves. **Flux is built to break that silence.**

To break it, the first step must be a 'quick start'—a way to turn that quiet intent into a loud commitment. For that, you need a plan that feels inevitable. But a plan alone isn't enough; most people fail because their **'Strategy'** (what to do) never actually meets their **'Execution'** (when to do it). Flux bridges this gap by merging them into a single reality: **The Execution Timeline**.

## 🛠️ Cloudflare Native Stack

We strictly adhere to the Cloudflare "Fast Track" requirements, leveraging the edge for maximum performance and consistency.

### 1. LLM: Workers AI

- **Model**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`.
- **Role**: Perceptive intent analysis and deterministic task scheduling.

### 2. Coordination: Cloudflare Workflows

- **The Architect**: A multi-step background workflow that brainstorms, estimates, and auto-schedules project plans. It ensures complex goals are broken down without blocking the user interface.

### 3. State Engine: Durable Objects

- **Consistency**: All timeline state lives in a Durable Object, providing strong transactional consistency across all sessions.
- **Real-time Sync**: Uses WebSockets to sync state changes to the UI within milliseconds.

### 4. Human Enablement: Web Speech API

- **Voice-to-Execution**: Integrated voice input allows users to "speak" tasks directly into existence, reducing friction to near zero.
- **Browser Support**: This feature leverages the `Web Speech API`, which is natively supported in **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, and **Safari**. (Note: The microphone icon will only be visible in supported browsers).

---

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

- **JSON Self-Healing**: The Architect workflow includes logic to detect and repair truncated or invalid JSON responses from the LLM, ensuring reliability at the edge.
- **Event Logging**: Every state mutation is logged as an immutable event, enabling full audit trails and providing a foundation for future "Time Travel" / Undo capabilities.
- **AI-Native Workflow**: This project was built using an AI-native development process. Our **System Prompts**, tool definitions, and architectural roadmap are documented in **[PROMPTS.md](./PROMPTS.md)**.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

This project uses **pnpm** for high-speed, deterministic builds. You don't need to install it globally—`npx` will handle it for you.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npx pnpm install

# 2. Authenticate (Required for Workers AI)
npx wrangler login

# 3. Develop (Local)
# Starts the React frontend + Cloudflare Worker environment
npx pnpm dev

# 4. Environment Variables
# Copy the example and adjust if needed
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# 5. Deploy (Production)
npx pnpm run deploy
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Why pnpm?** We chose pnpm to ensure 100% deterministic builds and to leverage its superior speed. If you prefer to use `npm` or `yarn`, we recommend sticking to `pnpm` via `npx` to maintain lockfile consistency.

### Environment Variables

| Variable    | Description                                               | Default  |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Set the logging level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). | `"info"` |

For production, you can set variables via the Cloudflare Dashboard.
